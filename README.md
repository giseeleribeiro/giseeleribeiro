👋 Hi, I’m Gisele 
👀 I’m interested in software engineering, artificial intelligence, data analysis, and user experience design.  
🌱 I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering with a focus on Artificial Intelligence at Torrens University.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that involve AI applications, data science, or intuitive user interfaces.  
📫 You can connect with me on https://www.linkedin.com/in/gisele-ribeiro-5466ab177/.  
😄 Pronouns: she/her  
⚡ Fun fact: When I step away from the keyboard, you’ll likely find me in the pool, on a yoga mat, or getting lost in a good thriller novel.
